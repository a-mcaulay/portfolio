# Alyssa McAulay â€” Projects & Portfolio

Recently completed BCompSci (GPA 6.6). Below are short descriptions of selected coursework and personal projects relevant to software engineering, cloud, and testing.

## Projects
### YOLO Object Detection (Quoll Detector)
Trained and evaluated multiple YOLOv8 models to detect quolls in trail camera images, balancing accuracy with lightweight performance. Preprocessed datasets with cleaning and augmentation to improve generalisation. Also trained an NLP tokenizer to generate captions for each image to describe if there were quolls visible and what they were doing
*Tech:* Python, PyTorch, YOLOv8, data preprocessing using LabelImg, 
*Overview:* Designed to support conservation efforts by automating population monitoring in bushfire-affected habitats.
*Result:* Produced a reliable quoll detection model with 73% mAP50, 71% precision, and 85% recall, supporting automated wildlife population monitoring in bushfire-affected areas.

### Secure Battleship Game (SSL Sockets)
Built a networked Battleship game with encrypted communication between client and server using SSL sockets. Implemented game logic, error handling, and secure message passing.
*Tech:* Java, SSL sockets, networking, object-oriented programming
*Overview:* Explored applied cryptography and secure systems through an interactive project.
*Result:* Demonstrated reliable secure connections and successful gameplay over local networks using different host addresses.

### Disability Services Booking System (Prototype)
Collaborated in a team to design and prototype a web application that allows clients to book disability assistance services. Implemented core booking functionality, user interface, and backend integration.
*Tech:* React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL
*Overview:* Project aimed to improve accessibility and usability of service scheduling platforms.
*Result:* Delivered a working prototype demonstrating booking flows and client/service management.

### Go Fish Web Application (against AI Player)
Collaboratively developed a single-player application of Go Fish, featuring a computer-controlled opponent with adjustable difficulty. Designed front-end interface and integrated game logic with AI decision-making.
*Tech:* Java, JavaFX, object-oriented programming
*Overview:* Demonstrated teamwork and full-stack development skills through a functional online game.
*Result:* Successfully implemented human vs. AI gameplay with scalable difficulty modes.
